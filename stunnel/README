Stunnel 4 configuration files.

Files found under the /etc/stunnel directory that end with .conf are
used by the stunnel4 service as configuration files, and each will be
used to start a daemon process setting up a tunnel with the given
configuration. Note that this directory is initially empty, as the
settings you may want for your tunnels are completely system dependent.

A sample configuration file with defaults may be found at
 /usr/share/doc/stunnel4/examples/stunnel.conf-sample
