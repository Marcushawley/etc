# DO NOT MODIFY/REMOVE THIS FILE - IT IS AUTO-GENERATED
#
# To remove/disable this, run dpkg-reconfigure localepurge
# and say no to/disable the "Use dpkg --path-exclude" option.
#
# To change what patterns are affected use:
# * dpkg-reconfigure localepurge
#   (to alter which locales are kept and whether manpages should
#    be purged)
# * Add a dpkg config file in /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d that is read
#   after this file with the necessary --path-include and
#   --path-exclude options.
#
# Report faulty patterns against the localepurge package.
